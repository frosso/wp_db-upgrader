wp_db-upgrader
==============

A library that allows you to deal with upgrades for your wordpress plugin.

I wrote a couple of plugins, but dealing with upgrades is a pain in the ass. Now all I have to do is add a new upgrade script every time a table (or some files) needs to be updated in conjunction with the code, and I'm all set.

I included a plugin as an example about how to use my code. You need to include the *upgrader* directory in it.

I wrote this plugin primarly for myself, but any contribution is very welcome.
